openssl-xcode
=============

This is an XCode project skeleton structure that can be used to build a static 
libcrypto.a library for use in Mac and iPhone projects. 

It is specifically intended for use in building secure iPhone 
applications alongside [SQLCipher](http://www.zetetic.net/software/sqlcipher).

openssl-xcode was developed by Stephen Lombardo at Zetetic LLC.

It was adapted for use with source archives by Michael Tyson of 
A Tasty Pixel (michael at atastypixel.com)

Usage
-----

In a normal case you would use it thusly:

1. Download the OpenSSL source code directly from
   http://www.openssl.org/source/ 

ARJU: tested with openssl-1.0.1a.tar.gz

2. Clone the openssl-xcode git repo to make a local copy
3. Put the downloaded OpenSSL source tar.gz into the same folder
   as openssl.xcodeproj.  
   The extracted OpenSSL distribution can also be placed in a folder called 'openssl'
   within the same folder as openssl.xcodeproj, or just extracted within the
   same folder as openssl.xcodeproj.

Then, either open openssl.xcodeproj in XCode and initiate a build, or integrate
it within another project:

1. Drag the openssl.xcodeproj file into your main project
2. Right-click on your project target, and add openssl.xcodeproj under "Direct
   Dependencies" on the General tab.
3. On the Build tab for your project's target, find the "Header Search Paths" 
   option, and add the path:
   > `$(SRCROOT)/Library/openssl/build/openssl.build/openssl/include`
   
   (Assuming you've put openssl.xcodeproj at the path Library/openssl, and are
   building from a source tarball)
4. Expand your target's "Link Binary With Libraries" build stage, and drag
   libcrypto.a from the openssl.xcodeproj group.


This project actually relies on the OpenSSL configure and make
system to build the libraries. However, it does attempt to automatically
detect and use the appropriate build settings for arch (i386/ppc/armv6),
build tools, and SDK directories. This makes it appropriate for inclusion
as a project reference into an iPhone application project.
